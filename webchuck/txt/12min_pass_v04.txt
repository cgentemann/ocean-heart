Subject:	New dataset for Chris

Here is a new dataset. It has several improvements: 
We have dive water pressure!
buoy data is only for sections 1 and 4
dive data has current (U, V, W, corresponding to NS, EW, and Up/Down, I think)
We have glitter! It also goes from 0 to 1, 1 is the brightest. It is the product of sun_elevation * windspeed. 
Seismic data is only for section 3

All data is from the same general location, the Milwaukee Trench.
